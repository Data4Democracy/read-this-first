## Project Maintainer

Maintainers are members who support our project leads to review all code being submitted to our repositories. Maintainers may work across projects or specialize on a single project. They are available in Slack to answer questions and help people with pull requests.

Guiding philosophy taken from our readme:
* **We believe good code is reviewed code.** All commits to this repository are approved by project maintainers and/or leads. The goal here is *not* to criticize or judge your abilities! Rather, we aim to share insights and achievements. Code reviews help us continually refine the project's scope and direction, as well as encourage the discussion we need for it to thrive.

#### Opportunities:
* Build deeper relationships with project team.
* Participate in discussions to determine project direction and focus.
* Hone your communication, collaboration and development skills.
* Reviewing code can be much more challenging than writing code. Grow your skill set by teaching and mentoring.

#### Responsibilities:
* Able to commit at least 5 hours a week (on average) to the project.
* Listed in the project readme as a resource.
* Perform code reviews, manage pull requests & branches.
* Make sure issue list stays organized. Close old issues, add proper issue labels, assign issues.
* Open `beginner-friendly` and `first-pr`. Mentor people who volunteer to take on these issues.
* Define milestones and help people to meet them.
* Be patient, kind and welcoming.

#### First tasks:
* Work with project lead to make the announcement in Slack, let people know they can reach out to you.
* Add yourself to the project readme.
* Start reviewing pull requests & grooming issues.
