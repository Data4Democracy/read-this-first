# Data for Democracy

Data for Democracy's mission is to be an inclusive community for data scientists and technologists to volunteer and collaborate on projects that make a positive impact on society.

## Who runs D4D?

The community does! Anybody who wants to contribute to making D4D better is **highly** encouraged to do so! Everything in D4D thus far has come from grassroots ideas proposed and pushed forward by a community member just like you and there's always more room for improvement. Whether it's starting a new project or proposing a new tool for the community to use, don't hesitate to just go for it!

## Getting Started  

* Read more about our our [origin story](https://medium.com/data-for-democracy/origin-story-b740f14ca6ed#.psbzqw21y).  
* We use Slack and GitHub as our primary means of organization and communication. Email team [at] datafordemocracy.org for an invite to the team.  
* Read about our [current projects](#current-projects), get involved [in your city](#city-groups), or check out how you can volunteer [across the community](#across-the-community).
* If you see a project you are interested in, join the project Slack channel, introduce yourself to the community and the project lead(s).  
* Visit project readme for specific instructions on who to contact or how to get started.
* Not sure which project you want to join? Introduce yourself in [#general](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/general/). Talk to a few project leads, let them know what you are interested in. Project leads can help you determine if a project is a good fit for you. The leads for each project are listed are [listed below](#current-projects).
* Have an idea for a new project? Join [#project-ideas](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/project-ideas/) to start a discussion on a new project.
* Looking for a certain type of task in any project? Check the [task digest](#task-digest).
* Not sure how to get started? Contact @gecky or @jonathon in the Slack, or check out the [#onboarding](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/onboarding/) channel, and we'll help you out. Also check out [#micro-projects](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/micro-projects/) for quick projects that'll help you get your feet wet.
* Want to pick up some skills before diving in? Check out the [tutorials](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/tutorials) which are all relevant to D4D projects and chat about it in [#learning](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/learning/).

See our guide to [get started](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/read-this-first/blob/master/data-world.md). Contact @sya or @gabriela in Slack with questions

## Across the Community

While most of our work is [project based](#current-projects), the community is large and vibrant enough that we're looking for common needs across projects that the organization can support. These are ongoing roles that can be time consuming, but are also essential to making the community helpful to our partners and a valuable experience for our volunteers. 

### Storytelling
All of our projects are doing some interesting data gathering and analysis that we regularly share with the world [on our blog](https://medium.com/data-for-democracy), our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKPgMFPkopC30c-jrabzoMw), and the [Partially Derivative podcast](http://partiallyderivative.com) ([for example](http://partiallyderivative.com/podcast/2017/03/21/robot-bartender-overlords)). If you'd like to help with this, ping @lillianj in Slack!  

### Infrastructure and IT administration
We're doing this on a per-project basis, along with [building tools for data science collaboration](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/docker-scaffolding), and always need help. Ping @aneel or @bstarling in Slack if you're up for helping out with this! 

### Matchmaker
The community has grown to a point where there is a lot of activity and a steady stream of new volunteers, which is awesome! We could use more people who know about the various projects that are happening along with the skills of the incoming volunteers, and can both match people to projects (ideally, to specific tasks), along with routinely surfacing new opportunities to the broader community for folks to get involved at all skill levels. Ping @gecky in Slack if this sounds like fun to you!

### Project Leads
You've probably noticed that there are a few people in every active project keeping the group on track, taking questions, and helping new folks get settled in -- that's by design. Leading a project can be a big time commitment, but it's hugely valuable to making sure we're doing useful work, and volunteers are getting the most out of volunteering. You don't need to be super technical, just organized and enthusiastic! Ping @jonathon in Slack if you're interested in leading a project.

## City groups
Data for Democracy volunteers are all over the world, and many cities have dedicated channels in Slack, and even regular in-person meetups to collaborate in person and work on data projects specific to their city or state. This is mostly US-based for now, but that's not on purpose, so feel free to spin up a group where you live! (We're looking at you London, Berlin, Warsaw, Bangalore, Sydney, and...). And of course, if you are in the US, there are probably at least a few D4D-ers where you live, so don't hesitate to start your own city group!

## Current projects  
We have many projects going in our slack community. Below is a list of some of our more active projects that are actively seeking help.

### [Assemble](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/assemble)  
**Slack:** [#assemble](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/assemble/)

**Project Description:** Community working to build tools and infrastructure to enable the study of online communities and their characteristics. As we work through our own projects, our goal is to build a toolkit which takes care of common tasks so researchers do not have to reinvent the wheel with each new project.  

**Project Leads:** [@bstarling](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@bstarling/) [@nick](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@nick/)

### [Boston Crash Modeling](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/boston-crash-modeling)
**Project Description:** This is an official collaboration between the City of Boston's Analytics Team and Data for Democracy. We want to build a crash prediction modeling application. This would combine things like [our crowdsourced safety concerns dataset](http://app01.cityofboston.gov/VZSafety/) and [crash reports](http://app01.cityofboston.gov/VisionZero/) with a wide range of other data from our own open data portal as well as from other sources like the state's transportation and transit agencies, weather conditions feeds, and traffic reports from sites like Google. The end result will be a set of dynamic predictions we can use to identify potential trouble spots and direct timely safety interventions--everything from protected bike lanes and better-marked crosswalks to new street lights and traffic light timings. We'll make this publicly-available to everyone through a hosted map application, and develop the project as an open source template that can be adapted for use by other cities.

**Slack:** [#boston-crash-modeling](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/boston-crash-modeling/)

**Project Leads:** [@therriault](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@therriault/) (City of Boston lead), [@niccolley](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@niccolley/) (Data for Democracy lead)

### [Indivisible](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/indivisible)  
**Slack:** [#indivisible](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/indivisible/)

**Project Description:** A variety of civic activism organizations have sprung up in the wake of the election to help mobilize and empower people. The organizations often operate by sending out daily or weekly “actions” that their supporters partake in – whether calling a Member of Congress’s office, attending an event, or reading a key piece of information. This project we will build tools to
* Identify various actions available for users by aggregating different sources of data
* Provide a clean user interface to filter and select actions they are interested in
* Build a dashboard and track action progress/effectiveness over time
* Engage user interest through social media or similar means to identify tasks for more effective actions

**We need software and web developers**

**Project Leads:** [@pg](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@pg/) [@bonfiam](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@bonfiam/)
