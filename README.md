## Current projects  
We have many projects going in our slack community. Below is a list of some of our more active projects that are actively seeking help.

### [Assemble](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/assemble)  
**Slack:** [#assemble](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/assemble/)

**Project Description:** Community working to build tools and infrastructure to enable the study of online communities and their characteristics. As we work through our own projects, our goal is to build a toolkit which takes care of common tasks so researchers do not have to reinvent the wheel with each new project.

What proportion of Medicare prescription spending is on each of those conditions?
